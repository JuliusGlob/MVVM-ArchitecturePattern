Compilation of some tests projects  applying the MVVM Architectural Pattern

Considerations: 
- The design of these apps is to make a solid base for an app.
- The scope of these projects was to improve Backend skills.
- Not much effort was put into making them look pretty.

They increase in complexity, starting with:
 - Good News App (Easy)
 - Hot Coffee App (Easy)
 - Stocks App (SwiftUI) (Medium)
 - Good Weather App (includes Bindings, Generics and Custom Dynamic Models)
